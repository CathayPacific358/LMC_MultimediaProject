										<p>It just seems to be a very simple day that Alex having different identities during different time periods, from being a 
											citizen, having certain type of favourite food in the morning to the boy friend identity during noon, then to being a son 
											in the late evening. Alex had different identities during this day. Which lead us to the main discussion - what is identity? 
											In perspectives of social science, identity is created by themselves and the group we belong to.
										</p>
										<p>
											Alex already formed the habbit of washing every day, which is very basical for every person. On the one hand, he considers that a tidy appearance is 
											needed in socialisation. On the other hand, objectively, it is also what he should do because this shows his respect to others.
										</p>
										<p>
											When Alex is having breakfast or actually when having each meals, he will always experience the development of minority identity in inercultural 
											communication. At the initial stage, Alex, as a northern chinese citizen who came to Zhuhai the first time, his identity in diet is a kind of minority 
											identity. As soon as he arrived Zhuhai, maybe he would not realised that Zhuhai, as a well developed costal SEZ(Special Economic Zone), is having a 
											much more humid climate, causing most of people surrounding would inevitably have different customs, which may make Alex a little bit not adapting. 
											Thereby, Alex was in the second stage called conformity, in which he woudl exert to adapt to the diet habbits or other customs. However, if Alex later selected 
											to maintain his northern diet habbit, it can be regarded that he was in the third stage - resistance and separatism.
										</p>
										<p>
											For other identities, Alex fell in love with his girlfriend while he tends to lead the whole group during the group discussion, which indicating that his identity 
											is actually changing that boyfriend and group leader are two roles with quite apparent distinction, which proved the perspective of interpretive. In comparison to 
											the perspective of social science, the perspective of interpretive is emphasising the dynamic turn, which is base on the communication between people. Alex's avowal is 
											that he want to better involve into the culture and not disturbed by his own identities so as to be smoother during his daily life and study. Despite his classmates will 
											ascribe him to northerner, it would not affect his normal life.
										</p>
										<p>
											To summarise, individual's identity is changing in different time, different place, with different people. These changes may have different reasons. For instance, Alex had a cold, he 
											chose to told his girlfriend but not his parents, because he want to share his situation without making his parents being conerned about him; Alex may be strict when he is allocating 
											everybody's work during the group discussion as a leader, but it will not bother him to be a nice person in dailylife. As we can see that each individual always have his/her own reason, 
											to do something, to prefer something, to love someone so as to form his/her identities. It is all these identities that making each person unique.
